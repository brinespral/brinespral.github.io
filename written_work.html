      <h2> His Perfect Day: A Profile on Diving Coach Randy Ableman</h2>
        <section id="left-col">
        <p>It’s a sunny day in Flamingo, Florida. The water is warm and reflective. You can smell the ocean’s waters and feel the ocean breeze. The catamaran stands still, with slight movement only when a boat drives by.</p>

        <p>Randy Ableman is standing in his catamaran with his shoes off. All you see are the tan lines from the sandals on his feet. His fishing rods are sticking in the water, waiting to be hooked onto some fish.</p>

        <p>It’s a perfect day.</p>

        <p>“I would consider myself a fisherman,” Ableman said. “It is something I really enjoy.”</p>

        <p>Water has almost always been and always will be incorporated into Ableman’s life. But his career did not start out in the water. Ableman was a trampolinist when he was a child, competing competitively. It was not until he began to endure a couple of bad accidents that he decided to try diving. And he has been in and out of the water ever since.</p>

        <p>“Pretty much this has been my only career and now I’m an old man.”</p>

        <p>Ableman now prefers to be out of the water; on a platform while at work or on a boat during his free time.</p>

        <p>Having coached divers for over 28 years at the University of Miami, Ableman knows the secret to coaching.</p>

        <p>“I think I have a vision of where you want your program and your divers to go and then having a game plan of how, on a daily basis, you are going to get them closer to that goal,” Ableman said. “I have a vision for each diver. I see their potential. And I make sure I don’t just see it but they see it too.”</p>

        <p>This vision that Ableman has is not only in diving, but in life as well. He said he hopes his divers are successful in more than one thing. Freshman diver, David Dinsmore looks up to his coach. He says Ableman is a “father figure/best friend” to him.</p>

        <p>“Being able to talk to him about anything is awesome because he is there to not only help me as a diver but as a person as well,” Dinsmore said.</p>

        <p>Dinsmore also considers Ableman his “personal hero”, referring to when Ableman was not able to attend the 1980 Olympic Games because of the boycott instilled by President Carter. Dinsmore placed third in the Olympic trials in 2016 and was one spot short in going to the Games. Both Dinsmore and Ableman share the pain of being so close, yet not attending.</p>

        <p>“If I could even be a quarter of the man he is, how caring and loving he is, and how excited he is about diving and life, that would be unbelievable,” Dinsmore said.</p>

        <p>That seems to be exactly what Ableman thought of his college coach who he considers his greatest influence. Bob Rydze coached Ableman at the University of Iowa where he was a four-time all-American, was the 1981 NCAA Champion in the 1-meter springboard, and holds the Hawkeye school record in the 3-meter springboard. Ableman always looked up to Rydze and respected him. He says Rydze transformed him.</p>

        <p>“It is sort of like how I perceived myself and how I am with my team now,” Ableman said. “I was a high school kid and all over the place. But by the time I got through, I knew what I wanted to do in life. He was a good mentor.”</p>

        <p>Ableman said Rydze instilled many values in him. But one quality that always describes Ableman is his love for family and love for life.</p>

        <p>A funny man, rarely serious. Ableman stops and smiles. Showing off his farmer’s tan from all the time he spends outdoors. When he is not outdoors, Ableman is inside. Cooking. He considers himself a “grill master”.</p>

        <p>His favorite food to cook?</p>

        <p>“My favorite thing is grilling fish and seafood like lobsters or conch or squid,” Ableman said. “Part of my perfect day is to catch the fish with my friends and then come home and grill it.”</p>

        <p>One of his daughters, Charlotte, says she likes to watch her dad cook because that is “when he is happiest”.</p>

        <p>“He loves to fish and cook what he catches,” she said. “We like fishing and cooking together. Spending time with him is always a treat.”</p>

        <p>As a family man, Ableman treats his team as if they are all part of his family. He usually has the whole diving team over his house once every two weeks for a group dinner where everyone helps prepare and cook the food.</p>

        <p>“My whole life revolves around my family and my job,” Ableman said. “I just try to keep things balanced. I have one big family.”</p>

        <p>Karen Ableman, Randy’s wife, said that Randy is more than just a coach to the kids. He is like a second father to them. She said he teaches more than just the sport, but about life, to help them develop through a critical part in their lives.</p>

        <p>“They have learned how to conduct themselves,” she said. “They learned how to be real adults. Helpful and social people. Thoughtful in their decision making. I think that is really what makes him special.”</p>

        <p>As the day turns to night, and Ableman finishes coaching and cooking, there is a longtime tradition he has with his wife.</p>

        <p>“Me and my wife finish most days with a nice little glass of Limoncello,” Ableman said. “We went to Italy many years ago and tried Limoncello for the first time. We loved it so much that I started making it here. it has become a common tradition throughout the years between us and has become a little treat.”</p>

        <p>Working, fishing, cooking, and drinking. A sunny day doing what he loves best. A day spent with his family and diving family.</p>

        <p>It’s a perfect day.</p>
